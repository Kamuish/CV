  abstract = {Methods. The model is a line-by-line radiative transfer code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. We use the sky conditions and the physical properties of the lines from the HITRAN database to create the telluric spectrum. This high-resolution model is then convolved with the instrumental resolution and sampled to the instrumental wavelength grid. A subset of selected telluric lines is used to robustly fit the spectrum through a Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt minimization algorithm. Results. We computed the model to the H2O lines in the spectral range of ESPRESSO. When applied to stellar spectra from A0- to M5-type stars, the residuals of the strongest water lines are below the 2\% peak-to-valley (P2V) amplitude for all spectral types, with the exception of M dwarfs, which are within the pseudo-continuum. We then determined the RVs from the telluric-corrected ESPRESSO spectra of Tau Ceti and Proxima. We created telluric-free masks and compared the obtained RVs with the DRS RVs. In the case of Tau Ceti, we identified that micro-telluric lines introduce systematics up to an amplitude of 58 cm s-1 and with a period of one year if not corrected. For Proxima, the impact of micro-telluric lines is negligible due to the low flux below 5900 {\AA}. For late-type stars, the gain in spectral content at redder wavelengths is equivalent to a gain of 25\% in photon noise or a factor of 1.78 in exposure time. This leads to better constraints on the semi-amplitude and eccentricity of Proxima d, which was recently proposed as a planet candidate. Finally, we applied our telluric model to the O2 {$\gamma$}-band and we obtained residuals below the 2\% P2V amplitude. Conclusions. We propose a simple telluric model for high-resolution spectrographs to correct individual spectra and to achieve precise RVs. The removal of micro-telluric lines, coupled with the gain in spectral range, leads to more precise RVs. Moreover, we showcase that our model can be applied to other molecules, and thus to other wavelength regions observed by other spectrographs, such as NIRPS.},

We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to model 57 precise radial velocity measurements acquired by the ESPRESSO spectrograph together with TESS photometry and complementary HARPS data. Our model includes a planetary component and Gaussian processes aimed at modeling the correlated stellar and instrumental noise. Results. We find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a radius of Rp = 1.52 {$\pm$} 0.12 R{$\oplus$} and a mass of Mp = 2.68 {$\pm$} 0.30 M{$\oplus$}. These values correspond to a density of {$\rho$} = 4.2 {$\pm$} 1.1 g{$\cdot$}cm-3, which is below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition. We find that atmospheric loss processes may have been efficient to remove a potential primordial hydrogen envelope, but high mean molecular weight volatiles such as water could have been retained. Our internal structure modeling suggests that TOI-244 b has a 479+-19268 km thick hydrosphere over a 1.17 {$\pm$} 0.09 R{$\oplus$} solid structure composed of a Fe-rich core and a silicate-dominated mantle compatible with that of the Earth. On a population level, we find two tentative trends in the density-metallicity and density-insolation parameter space for the low-density super-Earths, which may hint at their composition. Conclusions. With a 8\% precision in radius and 12\% precision in mass, TOI-244 b is among the most precisely characterized super-Earths, which, together with the likely presence of an extended hydrosphere, makes it a key target for atmospheric observations.},

Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, we refined the planet parameters, especially the orbital period. We collected 74 precise RVs with the HARPS-N spectrograph between August 2015 and October 2016. Although this planet was first found to transit in 2015 and validated in 2018, excess RV scatter originally limited mass measurements. Here, we measure a mass by taking advantage of reductions in scatter from updates to the HARPS-N Data Reduction System (2.3.5) and our new activity mitigation method called CCF Activity Linear Model (CALM), which uses activity-induced line shape changes in the spectra without requiring timing information. Using the CALM framework, we performed a joint fit with RVs and transits using EXOFASTv2 and find Mp = \$6.3\_\{-1.4\}\^\{+1.4\}\$ \,M{$\oplus$} and Rp = \$2.33\^\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.15\}\$ \,R{$\oplus$}, which places K2-167 b at the upper edge of the radius valley. We also find hints of a secondary companion at a {$\sim$} 22~day period, but confirmation requires additional RVs. Although characterizing lower-mass planets like K2-167 b is often impeded by stellar variability, these systems especially help probe the formation physics (i.e. photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss) of the radius valley. In the future, CALM or similar techniques could be widely applied to FGK-type stars, help characterize a population of exoplanets surrounding the radius valley, and further our understanding of their formation.},

A radial velocity analysis is performed to test the presence of planets in the system and to account for the stellar activity of this K5-K7 main sequence star. For benchmarking and comparison, we attempt the detection with 43 archive HARPS measurements and compare the results yielded by the two datasets. We also use four TESS sectors to search for transits. Results. We find radial velocity variations compatible with a close-in planet with an orbital period of P = 5.09071 {$\pm$} 0.00026 days when simultaneously accounting for the effects of stellar activity at longer time scales (Prot = 34.99+-00..5583 days). We characterize the physical and orbital properties of the planet and find a minimum mass of 5.57+-00..7638 M{$\oplus$}, right in the dichotomic regime between rocky and gaseous planets. Although not transiting according to TESS data, if aligned with the stellar spin axis, the absolute mass of the planet must be below 16 M{$\oplus$}. We find no significant evidence for additional signals in the data with semi-amplitudes above 56 cm s-1 at 95\% confidence. Conclusions. With a modest set of radial velocity measurements, ESPRESSO is capable of detecting and characterizing low-mass planets and constrain the presence of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs down to the rocky-mass regime.},

  abstract = {The detection of habitable worlds is one of humanity's greatest endeavors. Thus far, astrobiological studies have shown that one of the most critical components for allowing life to develop is liquid water. Its chemical properties and its capacity to dissolve and, hence, transport other substances makes this constituent a key piece in this regard. As a consequence, looking for life as we know it is directly related to the search for liquid water. For a remote detection of life in distant planetary systems, this essentially means looking for planets in the so-called habitable zone. In this sense, K-dwarf stars are the perfect hosts to search for planets in this range of distances. Contrary to G-dwarfs, the habitable zone is closer, thus making planet detection easier using transit or radial velocity techniques. Contrary to M-dwarfs, stellar activity is on a much smaller scale, hence, it has a smaller impact in terms of both the detectability and the true habitability of the planet. Also, K-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise. In spite of this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs due to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In response to a call for legacy programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have initiated the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around these stars: K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE). This survey is monitoring the radial velocity of 50 carefully pre-selected K-dwarfs with the CARMENES instrument over five semesters, with an average of 90 data points per target. Based on planet occurrence rates convolved with our detectability limits, we expect to find 1.68 {$\pm$} 0.25 planets per star in the KOBE sample. Furthermore, in half of the sample, we expect to find one of those planets within the habitable zone. Here, we describe the motivations, goals, and target selection for the project as well as the preliminary stellar characterization.},

  abstract = {GJ 9827 is a bright, nearby K7V star orbited by two super-Earths and one mini-Neptune on close-in orbits. The system was first discovered using K2 data and then further characterized by other spectroscopic and photometric instruments. Previous literature studies provide several mass measurements for the three planets, however, with large variations and uncertainties. To better constrain the planetary masses, we added high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO to published datasets from HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES and we performed a Gaussian process analysis combining radial velocity and photometric datasets from K2 and TESS. This method allowed us to model the stellar activity signal and derive precise planetary parameters. We determined planetary masses of Mb = 4.28+-00..3353 M{$\oplus$}, Mc = 1.86+-00..3379 M{$\oplus$}, and Md = 3.02-+00..5587 M{$\oplus$}, and orbital periods of 1.208974 {$\pm$} 0.000001 days for planet b, 3.648103+-00..000000001130 days for planet c, and 6.201812 {$\pm$} 0.000009 days for planet d. We compared our results to literature values and found that our derived uncertainties for the planetary mass, period, and radial velocity amplitude are smaller than the previously determined uncertainties. We modeled the interior composition of the three planets using the machine-learning-based tool ExoMDN and conclude that GJ 9827 b and c have an Earth-like composition, whereas GJ 9827 d has an hydrogen envelope, which, together with its density, places it in the mini-Neptune regime.},
