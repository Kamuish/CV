Short bio:
  - I am André Silva, a postdoctoral researcher at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço. My research spans instrumentation and exoplanetary science. I am currently working on the PoET solar telescope, leading the development of its observation software. In parallel, I focus on the development of novel algorithms for precise radial velocity extraction and analyze systematic effects that impact such measurements. Over the past three years, I have lectured an advanced course on Python, a Master's-level course on Bayesian statistics, and a PhD-level module on high-resolution spectroscopy.
