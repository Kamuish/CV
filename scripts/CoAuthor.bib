              ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTOs) at the 8.2m VLT telescope were performed to look for Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby stars. Barnard’s star is a primary target within the ESPRESSO GTO as it is the second closest neighbour to our Sun after the α Centauri stellar system.
            
            
              Aims.
              We present here a large set of 156 ESPRESSO observations of Barnard’s star carried out over four years with the goal of exploring periods of shorter than 50 days, thus including the habitable zone (HZ).
            
            
              Methods.
              Our analysis of ESPRESSO data using Gaussian process (GP) to model stellar activity suggests a long-term activity cycle at 3200 d and confirms stellar activity due to rotation at 140 d as the dominant source of radial velocity (RV) variations. These results are in agreement with findings based on publicly available HARPS, HARPS-N, and CARMENES data. ESPRESSO RVs do not support the existence of the previously reported candidate planet at 233 d.
            
            
              Results.
              After subtracting the GP model, ESPRESSO RVs reveal several short-period candidate planet signals at periods of 3.15 d, 4.12 d, 2.34 d, and 6.74 d. We confirm the 3.15 d signal as a sub-Earth mass planet, with a semi-amplitude of 55 ± 7 cm s
              −1
              , leading to a planet minimum mass

              , which is about three times the mass of Mars. ESPRESSO RVs suggest the possible existence of a candidate system with four sub-Earth mass planets in circular orbits with semi-amplitudes from 20 to 47 cm s
              −1

              The sub-Earth mass planet at 3.1533 ± 0.0006 d is in a close-to circular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.0229 ± 0.0003 AU, thus located inwards from the HZ of Barnard’s star, with an equilibrium temperature of 400 K. Additional ESPRESSO observations would be required to confirm that the other three candidate signals originate from a compact short-period planet system orbiting Barnard’s star inwards from its HZ.},

              Ultra hot Jupiters (gas giants with
              T
              eq
              {\textgreater} 2000 K) are intriguing exoplanets due to the extreme physics and chemistry present in their atmospheres. Their torrid daysides can be characterised using ground-based high-resolution emission spectroscopy.
            
            
              Aims.
              We search for signatures of neutral and singly ionised iron (Fe
              I
              and Fe
              II
              , respectively) in the dayside of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-76 b, as these species were detected via transmission spectroscopy in this exoplanet. Furthermore, we aim to confirm the existence of a thermal inversion layer, which has been reported in previous studies, and attempt to constrain its properties.
            
            
              Methods.
              We observed WASP-76 b on four epochs with ESPRESSO at the VLT, at orbital phases shortly before and after the secondary transit, when the dayside is in view. We present the first analysis of high-resolution optical emission spectra for this exoplanet. We compare the data to synthetic templates created with petitRADTRANS, using cross-correlation function techniques.
            
            
              Results.
              We detect a blueshifted (−4.7 ± 0.3 km s
              −1
              ) Fe
              I
              emission signature on the dayside of WASP-76 b at 6.0
              σ
              . The signal is detected independently both before and after the eclipse, and it is blueshifted in both cases. The presence of iron emission features confirms the existence of a thermal inversion layer. Fe
              II
              was not detected, possibly because this species is located in the upper layers of the atmosphere, which are more optically thin. Thus the Fe
              II
              signature on the dayside of WASP-76 b is too weak to be detected with emission spectroscopy.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              We propose that the blueshifted Fe
              I
              signature is created by material rising from the hot spot to the upper layers of the atmosphere, and discuss possible scenarios related to the position of the hotspot. This work unveils some of the dynamic processes ongoing on the dayside of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-76 b through the analysis of the Fe
              I
              signature from its atmosphere, and complements previous knowledge obtained from transmission studies. It also highlights the ability of ESPRESSO to probe the dayside of this class of exoplanets.},

The system was first discovered using K2 data and then further characterized by other spectroscopic and photometric instruments. Previous literature studies provide several mass measurements for the three planets, however, with large variations and uncertainties. To better constrain the planetary masses, we added high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO to published datasets from HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES and we performed a Gaussian process analysis combining radial velocity and photometric datasets from K2 and TESS. This method allowed us to model the stellar activity signal and derive precise planetary parameters. We determined planetary masses of

            We report on the detailed characterization of the HD 77946 planetary system. HD 77946 is an F5 (M* = 1.17 M⊙, R* = 1.31 R⊙) star, which hosts a transiting planet recently discovered by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), classified as TOI-1778 b. Using TESS photometry, high-resolution spectroscopic data from HARPS-N, and photometry from CHEOPS, we measure the radius and mass from the transit and RV observations, and find that the planet, HD 77946 b, orbits with period Pb = \$6.527282\_\{-0.000020\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.000015\}\$ d, has a mass of Mb = 8.38 ± 1.32 M⊕, and a radius of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} = 2.705\_\{-0.081\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.086\}\$R⊕. From the combination of mass and radius measurements, and the stellar chemical composition, the planet properties suggest that HD 77946 b is a sub-Neptune with a ∼1\% H/He atmosphere. However, a degeneracy still exists between water-world and silicate/iron-hydrogen models, and even though interior structure modelling of this planet favours a sub-Neptune with a H/He layer that makes up a significant fraction of its radius, a water-world composition cannot be ruled out, as with \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eq\}{\textasciitilde}= 1248{\textasciicircum}\{+40\}\_\{-38\}{\textasciitilde}\$K, water may be in a supercritical state. The characterisation of HD 77946 b, adding to the small sample of well-characterised sub-Neptunes, is an important step forwards on our journey to understanding planetary formation and evolution pathways. Furthermore, HD 77946 b has one of the highest transmission spectroscopic metrics for small planets orbiting hot stars, thus transmission spectroscopy of this key planet could prove vital for constraining the compositional confusion that currently surrounds small exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Context.
              Ground-based observing time is precious in the era of exoplanet follow-up and characterization, especially in high-precision radial velocity instruments. Blind-search radial velocity surveys thus require a dedicated observational strategy in order to optimize the observing time, which is particularly crucial for the detection of small rocky worlds at large orbital periods.
            
            
              Aims.
              We developed an algorithm with the purpose of improving the efficiency of radial velocity observations in the context of exoplanet searches, and we applied it to the K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets experiment. Our aim is to accelerate exoplanet confirmations or, alternatively, reject false signals as early as possible in order to save telescope time and increase the efficiency of both blind-search surveys and follow-up of transiting candidates.
            
            
              Methods.
              Once a minimum initial number of radial velocity datapoints is reached in such a way that a periodicity starts to emerge according to generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms, that period is targeted with the proposed algorithm, named KOBEsim. The algorithm selects the next observing date that maximizes the Bayesian evidence for this periodicity in comparison with a model with no Keplerian orbits.
            
            
              Results.
              By means of simulated data, we proved that the algorithm accelerates the exoplanet detection, needing 29-33\% fewer observations and a 41–47\% smaller time span of the full dataset for low-mass planets (

              planets we found a 16\% enhancement in the number of datapoints. We also tested KOBEsim with real data for a particular KOBE target and for the confirmed planet HD 102365 b. These two tests demonstrate that the strategy is capable of speeding up the detection by up to a factor of 2 (i.e., reducing both the time span and number of observations by half).},

              We intend to confirm and characterize the TESS planet candidate TOI-244.01, which orbits the bright (
              K
              = 7.97 mag), nearby (
              d
              = 22 pc), and early-type (M2.5 V) M-dwarf star GJ 1018 with an orbital period of 7.4 days.
            
            
              Methods.
              We used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to model 57 precise radial velocity measurements acquired by the ESPRESSO spectrograph together with TESS photometry and complementary HARPS data. Our model includes a planetary component and Gaussian processes aimed at modeling the correlated stellar and instrumental noise.
            
            
              Results.
              We find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a radius of
              R
              p
              = 1.52 ± 0.12
              R
              ⊕
              and a mass of
              M
              p
              = 2.68 ± 0.30
              M
              ⊕
              . These values correspond to a density of
              ρ
              = 4.2 ± 1.1 g cm
              −3
              , which is below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition. We find that atmospheric loss processes may have been efficient to remove a potential primordial hydrogen envelope, but high mean molecular weight volatiles such as water could have been retained. Our internal structure modeling suggests that TOI-244 b has a 479
              −96
              +128
              km thick hydrosphere over a 1.17 ± 0.09
              R
              ⊕
              solid structure composed of a Fe-rich core and a silicate-dominated mantle compatible with that of the Earth. On a population level, we find two tentative trends in the density-metallicity and density-insolation parameter space for the low-density super-Earths, which may hint at their composition.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              With a 8\% precision in radius and 12\% precision in mass, TOI-244 b is among the most precisely characterized super-Earths, which, together with the likely presence of an extended hydrosphere, makes it a key target for atmospheric observations.},

	abstract = {The detection of habitable worlds is one of humanity’s greatest endeavors. Thus far, astrobiological studies have shown that one of the most critical components for allowing life to develop is liquid water. Its chemical properties and its capacity to dissolve and, hence, transport other substances makes this constituent a key piece in this regard. As a consequence, looking for life as we know it is directly related to the search for liquid water. For a remote detection of life in distant planetary systems, this essentially means looking for planets in the so-called habitable zone. In this sense, K-dwarf stars are the perfect hosts to search for planets in this range of distances. Contrary to G-dwarfs, the habitable zone is closer, thus making planet detection easier using transit or radial velocity techniques. Contrary to M-dwarfs, stellar activity is on a much smaller scale, hence, it has a smaller impact in terms of both the detectability and the true habitability of the planet. Also, K-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise. In spite of this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs due to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In response to a call for legacy programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have initiated the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around these stars: K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE). This survey is monitoring the radial velocity of 50 carefully pre-selected K-dwarfs with the CARMENES instrument over five semesters, with an average of 90 data points per target. Based on planet occurrence rates convolved with our detectability limits, we expect to find 1.68 ± 0.25 planets per star in the KOBE sample. Furthermore, in half of the sample, we expect to find one of those planets within the habitable zone. Here, we describe the motivations, goals, and target selection for the project as well as the preliminary stellar characterization.},

When it is possible to apply both techniques, we can characterise the internal composition of exoplanets, which in turn provides unique insights on their architecture, formation and evolution. We performed a combined photometric and RV analysis of TOI-238 (TYC 6398-132-1), which has one short-orbit super-Earth planet candidate announced by NASA’s TESS team. We aim to confirm its planetary nature using radial velocities taken with the ESPRESSO and HARPS spectrographs, to measure its mass, and to detect the presence of other possible planetary companions. We carried out a joint analysis by including Gaussian processes and Keplerian orbits to account for the stellar activity and planetary signals simultaneously. We detected the signal induced by TOI-238 b in the RV time series, and the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-238 c, whose signal appears in RV and TESS data.

            We report precise radial velocity (RV) observations of HD 212657 (= K2-167), a star shown by K2 to host a transiting sub-Neptune-sized planet in a 10 day orbit. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, we refined the planet parameters, especially the orbital period. We collected 74 precise RVs with the HARPS-N spectrograph between August 2015 and October 2016. Although this planet was first found to transit in 2015 and validated in 2018, excess RV scatter originally limited mass measurements. Here, we measure a mass by taking advantage of reductions in scatter from updates to the HARPS-N Data Reduction System (2.3.5) and our new activity mitigation method called CCF Activity Linear Model (CALM), which uses activity-induced line shape changes in the spectra without requiring timing information. Using the CALM framework, we performed a joint fit with RVs and transits using EXOFASTv2 and find Mp = \$6.3\_\{-1.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$  M⊕ and Rp = \$2.33{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.15\}\$  R⊕, which places K2-167 b at the upper edge of the radius valley. We also find hints of a secondary companion at a ∼ 22 day period, but confirmation requires additional RVs. Although characterizing lower-mass planets like K2-167 b is often impeded by stellar variability, these systems especially help probe the formation physics (i.e. photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss) of the radius valley. In the future, CALM or similar techniques could be widely applied to FGK-type stars, help characterize a population of exoplanets surrounding the radius valley, and further our understanding of their formation.},

	abstract = {Methods. We use 41 ESPRESSO measurements of HD 22496 obtained within a time span of 895 days with a median photon noise of 18 cm s−1. A radial velocity analysis is performed to test the presence of planets in the system and to account for the stellar activity of this K5-K7 main sequence star. For benchmarking and comparison, we attempt the detection with 43 archive HARPS measurements and compare the results yielded by the two datasets. We also use four TESS sectors to search for transits.
Results. We ﬁnd radial velocity variations compatible with a close-in planet with an orbital period of P = 5.09071 ± 0.00026 days when simultaneously accounting for the eﬀects of stellar activity at longer time scales (Prot = 34.99+−00..5583 days). We characterize the physical and orbital properties of the planet and ﬁnd a minimum mass of 5.57+−00..7638 M⊕, right in the dichotomic regime between rocky and gaseous planets. Although not transiting according to TESS data, if aligned with the stellar spin axis, the absolute mass of the planet must be below 16 M⊕. We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant evidence for additional signals in the data with semi-amplitudes above 56 cm s−1 at 95\% conﬁdence.
Conclusions. With a modest set of radial velocity measurements, ESPRESSO is capable of detecting and characterizing low-mass planets and constrain the presence of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs down to the rocky-mass regime.},

	abstract = {Methods. The model is a line-by-line radiative transfer code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. We use the sky conditions and the physical properties of the lines from the HITRAN database to create the telluric spectrum. This high-resolution model is then convolved with the instrumental resolution and sampled to the instrumental wavelength grid. A subset of selected telluric lines is used to robustly fit the spectrum through a Levenberg–Marquardt minimization algorithm.
Results. We computed the model to the H2O lines in the spectral range of ESPRESSO. When applied to stellar spectra from A0- to M5-type stars, the residuals of the strongest water lines are below the 2\% peak-to-valley (P2V) amplitude for all spectral types, with the exception of M dwarfs, which are within the pseudo-continuum. We then determined the RVs from the telluric-corrected ESPRESSO spectra of Tau Ceti and Proxima. We created telluric-free masks and compared the obtained RVs with the DRS RVs. In the case of Tau Ceti, we identified that micro-telluric lines introduce systematics up to an amplitude of 58 cm s−1 and with a period of one year if not corrected. For Proxima, the impact of micro-telluric lines is negligible due to the low flux below 5900 Å. For late-type stars, the gain in spectral content at redder wavelengths is equivalent to a gain of 25\% in photon noise or a factor of 1.78 in exposure time. This leads to better constraints on the semi-amplitude and eccentricity of Proxima d, which was recently proposed as a planet candidate. Finally, we applied our telluric model to the O2 γ-band and we obtained residuals below the 2\% P2V amplitude.
Conclusions. We propose a simple telluric model for high-resolution spectrographs to correct individual spectra and to achieve precise RVs. The removal of micro-telluric lines, coupled with the gain in spectral range, leads to more precise RVs. Moreover, we showcase that our model can be applied to other molecules, and thus to other wavelength regions observed by other spectrographs, such as NIRPS.},

	abstract = {Context
              . K-dwarf stars are promising targets in the exploration of potentially habitable planets. Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an optimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection. The KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring the radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES spectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the habitable zone of their system.
            
            
              Aims
              . In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to characterize planetary signals in the K7 V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to constrain the planetary population within its habitable zone.
            
            
              Methods
              . We used 82 CARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram to search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with Keplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian framework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative configurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS sectors in search of planetary signals.
            
            
              Results
              . We identified two signals: at
              P
              b
              = 8.5 d and
              P
              c
              = 29.7 d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other non-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80 ± 0.76 M
              ⊕
              (KOBE-1 b), and 12.4 ± 1.1 M
              ⊕
              (KOBE-1 c), corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a high certainty ({\textgreater}99.7\%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time series to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5 M
              ⊕
              within the habitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose origin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1
              σ
              with a transit from planet c.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . The KOBE-1 multi-planetary system, consisting of a relatively quiet K7-dwarf hosting two sub-Neptune-minimum- mass planets, establishes the first discovery from the KOBE experiment. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this system, concluding that
              Gaia
              DR4 will be insensitive to their astrometric signature. Meanwhile, nulling interferometry with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission could be capable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres in future studies.},

              Close-by Earth analogs and super-Earths are of primary importance because they will be preferential targets for the next generation of direct imaging instruments. Bright and close-by G-to-M type stars are preferential targets in radial velocity surveys to find Earth analogs.

              We present an analysis of the RV data of the star HD 20794, a target whose planetary system has been extensively debated in the literature. The broad time span of the observations makes it possible to find planets with signal semi-amplitudes below 1 m s

              in the habitable zone.
            
            
              Methods.
              We analyzed RV datasets spanning more than 20 years. We monitored the system with ESPRESSO. We joined ESPRESSO data with the HARPS data, including archival data and new measurements from a recent program. We applied the post-processing pipeline YARARA to HARPS data to correct systematics, improve the quality of RV measurements, and mitigate the impact of stellar activity.
            
            
              Results.
              We confirm the presence of three planets, with periods of 18.3142 ± 0.0022 d, 89.68 ± 0.10 d, and 647.6
              −2.7
              +2.5
              d, along with masses of 2.15 ± 0.17 M⊕, 2.98 ± 0.29 M⊕, and 5.82 ± 0.57 M⊕ respectively. For the outer planet, we find an eccentricity of 0.45
              −0.11
              +0.10
              , whereas the inner planets are compatible with circular orbits. The latter is likely to be a rocky planet in the habitable zone of HD 20794. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period of {\textasciitilde}3000 d, along with evidence pointing to a rotation period of {\textasciitilde}39 d.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              We have determined the presence of a system of three planets orbiting the solar-type star HD 20794. This star is bright (V=4.34 mag) and close (d = 6.04 pc), and HD 20794 d resides in the stellar habitable zone, making this system a high-priority target for future atmospheric characterization with direct imaging facilities.},
