The RV analysis includes a component to model Proxima’s activity using a Gaussian process (GP). We use the CCF’s full width at half maximum to help constrain the GP, and we study other simultaneous observables as activity indicators in order to assess the nature of any potential RV signals.},

	abstract = {Context
              . K-dwarf stars are promising targets in the exploration of potentially habitable planets. Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an optimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection. The KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring the radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES spectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the habitable zone of their system.
            
            
              Aims
              . In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to characterize planetary signals in the K7 V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to constrain the planetary population within its habitable zone.
            
            
              Methods
              . We used 82 CARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram to search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with Keplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian framework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative configurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS sectors in search of planetary signals.
            
            
              Results
              . We identified two signals: at
              P
              b
              = 8.5 d and
              P
              c
              = 29.7 d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other non-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80 ± 0.76 M
              ⊕
              (KOBE-1 b), and 12.4 ± 1.1 M
              ⊕
              (KOBE-1 c), corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a high certainty ({\textgreater}99.7\%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time series to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5 M
              ⊕
              within the habitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose origin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1
              σ
              with a transit from planet c.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . The KOBE-1 multi-planetary system, consisting of a relatively quiet K7-dwarf hosting two sub-Neptune-minimum- mass planets, establishes the first discovery from the KOBE experiment. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this system, concluding that
              Gaia
              DR4 will be insensitive to their astrometric signature. Meanwhile, nulling interferometry with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission could be capable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres in future studies.},

	abstract = {Context
              . The radial velocity (RV) method plays a key role in modern-day astrophysics. One of the most common techniques for extracting precise RVs from state-of-the-art spectrographs is template-matching (TM) algorithms. They have been shown to perform better than a cross-correlation function (CCF) approach in cases of cooler stars (e.g. M dwarfs) and multiple implementations have appeared over the past years. More recently, line-by-line (LBL) approaches offer an alternative avenue to extract RVs by analyzing individual spectral lines.
            
            
              Aims
              . In this paper, we identify and explore a previously unidentified, multi-meter-per-second, systematic correlation between time and RVs inferred through TM and LBL methods. We evaluate the influence of the data-driven stellar template in the RV bias and hypothesise on the possible sources of this effect.
            
            
              Methods
              . We used the
              s-BART
              pipeline to extract RVs from three different datasets gathered over four nights of ESPRESSO and HARPS observations. We demonstrate that the effect can be recovered on a larger sample of 19 targets, totalling 4124 ESPRESSO observations over 38 nights. We also showcase the presence of the bias in RVs extracted with the
              SERVAL
              and
              ARVE
              pipelines. Lastly, we explore the construction of the stellar template over the five years of ESPRESSO observations of HD 10700, totalling more than 2000 observations.
            
            
              Results
              . We find that a systematic quasi-linear bias affects the RV extraction with slopes that vary from —0.3 ms
              −1
              h
              −1
              to —52 m s
              −1
              h
              −1
              in our sample. This trend is not observed in CCF RVs and only appears when all observations of a given star are collected within a short time period (timescales of hours). We show that this systematic contamination exists in the RV time series of two different template-matching pipelines and one line-by-line pipeline, and it is agnostic to the spectrograph. We also find that this effect is linked to the construction of the stellar template, as we were able to mitigate it through a careful selection of the observations used to construct it. Our results suggest that a contamination of micro-telluric features, coupled with other sources of correlated noise, could be the driving factor of this effect. We also show that this effect does not impact the usual usage of template-matching for the detection and characterisation of exoplanets. However, the short-timescale science cases, such as asteroseismology as well as transit and atmospheric characterisation, can be severely affected.},

	abstract = {Aims
              . We analyse ESPRESSO data for the stars HD 10700 (
              τ
              Ceti), HD 20794 (
              e
              Eridani), HD 102365, and HD 304636 acquired via its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) programme. We characterise the stars’ radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10 cm/s on timescales ranging from minutes to planetary periods falling within the host’s habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while undetectable remain compatible with the available data.
            
            
              Methods
              . We derived the stellar parameters through different methods for a complete characterisation of the star. We used these parameters to model the effects of stellar pulsations on intra-night RV variations and of stellar activity on nightly averaged values. The RVs were derived both with the cross-correlation method and template matching, as well as over the blue and red ESPRESSO detectors independently to identify colour-dependent parasitic effects of an instrumental or stellar nature. The study of RVs was complemented by an investigation of stellar activity indicators using photospheric information and chromospheric indexes.
            
            
              Results
              . A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night RV scatter of HD 10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD 102365 and HD 20794, an additional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary to explain the data. A
              kima
              analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets supported by the nightly averaged time series of each of these three stars, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP) regression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of HD 10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20 d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. Moreover, its physical origin remains uncertain due to the similarity with the first harmonic of the stellar rotation. ESPRESSO data on their own do not provide conclusive evidence to support the existence of planets around HD 10700, HD 102365, or HD 304636. In addition, the comparison of RVs with the contemporaneous indicators displays a strong correlation for HD 102365. The direct interpretation is that half of the RV variance on this star is directly attributed to activity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on short timescales ({\textless}1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20–30 cm/s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD 10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of 1.7 M
              ⊕
              for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2–5 M
